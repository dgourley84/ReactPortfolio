## Description
This is my updated personal portfolio website built using React.js.

It provides an insight into who I am as a developer and gives possible employers an opportunity to contact me.

Upon arrival, the user will land on the home page as seen below:
![home](./src/assets/home.png)

next, using the navigation bar on the top right, a user can access the about me or projects pages to see more information:

![about](./src/assets/AboutMe.png)

The website is mobile responsive and the most prevelant feature of this is the navigation bar becoming a hamburger menu on mobile devices.
